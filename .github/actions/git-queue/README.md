If you need to pass environment variables to the `git` child process, you only need to set those variables by using the `env` section in the action:

```yml
- name: Create job
  id: create-job
  uses: ./.github/actions/git-queue
  with:
    queue_name: "Library Update [library-aaa]"
    action: "create-job"
    job_payload: "job_payload"
  env:
    GNUPGHOME: '~/.gnupg'
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: 'A Committer'
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: 'committer@example.com'
    GIT_AUTHOR_DATE: '2005-04-07T22:13:13'
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: 'A Committer'
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: 'committer@example.com'
    GIT_COMMITTER_DATE: '2005-04-07T22:13:13'
```

## Development

Install:

```shell
yarn install
```

Build:

```shell
yarn run build
```

Run tests:

```shell
yarn run test
```

Run the app locally:

```shell
yarn run build && \
INPUT_QUEUE_NAME="Library Update [library-aaa]" \
INPUT_ACTION="next-job" \
  node dist/index.js
```

Run the test workflow locally with `act`:

```shell
act -w ./.github/workflows/test-git-job-action.yml -j build
```

> NOTE: act is not working because [they have not released yet](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/910#issuecomment-1017536955) the new version supporting `node16`.
